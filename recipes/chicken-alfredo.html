    <h2>Description:</h2>
    <p>This recipe is quick and easy and any novice cook can do it. It was made for the little ones
        who always wanted to order out at Pizza Hut® or Olive Garden®. Serve with additional Parmesan
        cheese if desired. This recipe can also be eaten without being baked but the kids love that it
        resembles baked casseroles found in restaurants.</p>

    <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>16oz penne pasta</li>
        <li>1/2 cup butter</li>
        <li>2 tsp minced garlic</li>
        <li>8oz creame cheese</li>
        <li>2 cups milk</li>
        <li>6oz gratted parmesan cheese</li>
        <li>2 tsp dried parsley</li>
        <li>1 tsp italian seasoning</li>
        <li>1 tsp salt</li>
        <li>1/2 tsp ground black pepper</li>
        <li>1 tsp olive oil</li>
        <li>2 chicken breasts</li>
        <li>1/2 tsp garlic powder</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Directions:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil; add penne and cook, stirring occasionally, until tender
            yet firm to the bite, about 11 minutes. Drain.</li>
        <li>Melt butter in a large saucepan over medium-high heat. Add minced garlic; saute until golden, about 30
            seconds. Stir in cream cheese until smooth. Add milk; stir until there are no lumps. Lower heat to medium.
            Add 3/4 of the Parmesan cheese, parsley, Italian seasoning, 1/2 teaspoon salt, and black pepper. Simmer,
            stirring occasionally, until sauce is smooth, about 5 minutes. Remove from heat.</li>
        <li>Heat olive oil in a large skillet over low heat. Season chicken with 1/2 teaspoon salt and garlic powder on
            both sides. Cook chicken breasts until no longer pink in the center and an instant-read thermometer inserted
            into the center reads at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C), about 6 minutes per side. Cut chicken into
            1/2-inch cubes.</li>
        <li>Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Butter bottom and sides of a 9x13-inch casserole dish. Cover bottom with a layer of pasta. Place half of the
            chicken cubes on top. Pour 1/2 of the sauce over the chicken. Repeat layering pasta, chicken, and sauce.
            Sprinkle top with remaining Parmesan cheese. Cover with aluminum foil.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until sauce is bubbly, about 15 minutes. Remove aluminum foil and bake until
            cheese is golden, about 5 minutes more.</li>
    </ol>
