        <h1>Mexican Lasagna:</h1>
        <p>My whole family loves this beefy lasagna flavored with taco seasoning. 
            Even my picky five-year-old will eat it. Serve with shredded lettuce, 
            fresh sliced tomatoes, olives and sour cream.</p>

        <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1lb lean ground beef</li>
            <li>1oz taco seasoning mix</li>
            <li>14oz can peeled diced tomatoes</li>
            <li>10 (6in) corn tortillas</li>
            <li>1 cup prepared salso</li>
            <li>1/2 cup shredded Colby cheese</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Directions:</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</li>
            <li>In a large skillet over medium-high heat, brown the ground beef, 
                and stir in the taco seasoning and tomatoes. Line a 9x13-inch baking 
                dish with half the tortillas. Spoon the beef mixture into the dish, 
                then top with the remaining tortillas. Spread salsa over the tortillas 
                and sprinkle with the cheese.</li>
            <li>Bake at 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) for 20 to 30 minutes, 
                or until cheese is melted and bubbly.</li>
        </ol>
